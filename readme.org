#+TITLE: MRSI PFC R

Original git repo for GABA vs Glu paper.
Now also hosting general GAM adjusted MRSI for the PFC slice.

* Outputs
#+begin_src shell :results output verbatim
ls -tlrc out
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* Gotchas

  * thresholding value( abs(z)<3 ) and grouping (bilateral per metabolite) may not be ideal
  * general bugs from integrating (but see `test_*R` files)

* Files
  * ~Makefile~ tries to list what scripts make what files and annotate their dependencies
  * ~mrsi_funcs.R~ has functions to clean, add columns (invage, age2, dateNumeric), and reshape from wide to long (useful for plotting and summarise over metabolite and region) -- though the output files should have the output of those, so hopefully only useful for posterity
  * ~adjust_all.R~ runs per bilateral region+metabolite gam residual adjustment, but only for a few metabolites. But it's hopefully easy to extend
#+begin_src R :eval never
mets_keep <- c("GABA","Glu","Gln","Cho","Glc", "MM20")
#+end_src


* Make
~Makefile~ attempts to record provenance of outputs.

run ~make~ to update only the outputs that are out of date.

* Wide to Long
~mrsi_funcs.R~ defines ~longer_met_CrSD()~ which reshape
the wide (many columns) per-metabolite .Cr and .SD columns into 
a longer (more rows) dataframe with repeating samples: a row for each metabolite.
New columns are ~'met'~, ~'Cr'~, and ~'SD'~ replace the original columns GABA.Cr, GABA.SD, Glu.Cr, ....


Long format data is easier to plot and group_by/summarize (or in non-tidyverse speak ~map + reduce~)

* Thresholding
Per region per metabolite abs(zscore) threshold of 3 yields. (20230531 -- TODO: confirm best strategy) 
[[file:imgs/thresholding_cnt_met_region.png]]

* GAM adjustment
see ~adjust_all.R~ and ~visualize.R~

[[file:imgs/gam_adjusted_Vs_Cr.png]]

* Testing
~./test_mrsi_funcs.R~ and ~./test_res_with_age.R~ exercises some functions
#+begin_src R :session :results output verbatim
invisible(lapply(Sys.glob("test_*R"),testthat::test_file) )
#+end_src

* Merge 7T
~out/gamadj_wide.csv~ is added to merge7T.csv many directories up from here (20230531).
External measures (e.g. rest framewise displacement) are not included in this output
because they are expected to be merged from the original source there.
