#+TITLE: MRSI PFC R

Original git repo for GABA vs Glu paper.
Now also hosting general GAM adjusted MRSI for the PFC slice.

* Make
~Makefile~ attempts to record provenance of outputs.

run ~make~ to update only the outputs that are out of date.

* Wide to Long
~mrsi_funcs.R~ defines ~longer_met_CrSD()~ which reshape
the wide (many columns) per-metabolite .Cr and .SD columns into 
a longer (more rows) dataframe with repeating samples: a row for each metabolite.
New columns are ~'met'~, ~'Cr'~, and ~'SD'~ replace the original columns GABA.Cr, GABA.SD, Glu.Cr, ....


Long format data is easier to plot and group_by/summarize (or in non-tidyverse speak ~map + reduce~)

* Thresholding
Per region per metabolite abs(zscore) threshold of 3 yields. (20230531 -- TODO: confirm best strategy)

* GAM adjustment
see ~adjust_all.R~ and ~visualize.R~

[[file:imgs/gam_adjusted_Vs_Cr.png]]

* Testing
~./test_mrsi_funcs.R~ and ~./test_res_with_age.R~ exercises some functions
#+begin_src R :session :results output verbatim
invisible(lapply(Sys.glob("test_*R"),testthat::test_file) )
#+end_src

* Merge 7T
~out/gamadj_wide.csv~ is added to merge7T.csv many directories up from here (20230531).
External measures (e.g. rest framewise displacement) are not included in this output
because they are expected to be merged from the original source there.
